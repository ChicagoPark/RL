## 1. Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)
agent: Maximize the cumulative reward
value function: 1. generates expected return / 2. suggests the background that agent consider to act / 3. Policy

State-value function: v(s)
Action-value function: q(s, a) # q means "QUALITY". It is the same notation from Q-table. We can understand it to estimate the quality of (state, action)
Optimal action-value function: q*(s, a) # find the maximum value from all the policies in the state.
